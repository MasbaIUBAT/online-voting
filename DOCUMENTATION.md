It looks like the formatting isn't quite up to the mark for a proper **Markdown** file. Here's a **well-formatted version** that you can directly use in your `DOCUMENTATION.md` file. I'll use proper headings, lists, and code blocks for better readability.

### **Key Changes in the Format**:
- Added **headings** with `#` for better structure.
- Used **unordered lists** for features, prerequisites, etc.
- **Code blocks** for commands using triple backticks (```) for easy copy-pasting.
- The **project structure** is represented with a code block for better readability.

You can now **copy and paste** this into your `DOCUMENTATION.md` file. This formatting will look great when viewed on GitHub, and it will also be easy to read for anyone using it.
